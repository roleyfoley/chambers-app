Feature: Register Certificates of Origin using the web site
  So that confusion and delay is minimised at the point of import
  As a Delegated Authority (such as a Chamber of Commerce)
  I need to register my CO on the chambers_app web interface



# this is too epic

TODO:
 * log in as a Chamber Staff
 * create a CO identifier (draft CO)
 * upload documents to the CO identifier
 * finalise draft CO (status=pending)
 * recieve updates about status=lodged
 * receive updates about status=failed
 * search/browse/etc
